This project is an earnest attempt in understanding the root (dhātu) of all the 108 karaṇa​s. As the Nāṭyaśāstra​ encompasses movement vocabularies inspired by nature, it is imperative to understand the plausible meanings of every karaṇa. In line with the same, Sharat R Prabhath, under the guidance of the Professors and Asst. Professors of Karnataka Samskrit University has come out with this project to create a vista of deeper and meaningful understanding of the nomenclature, for all the serious pursuers of 'Bharatanṛtyam', reconstructed by Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam.

In creating this work, a few literary works were referred to. The authors and books that were of a great value are:

1. Karaṇa​s - Common Dance Codes of India and Indonesia (Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam)
2. A Treatise on Ancient Indian Dramaturgy and Histrionics (Manmohan Ghosh)
3. Images credit - Bharatanāṭya Digdarśana​ (VS Kaushik)
