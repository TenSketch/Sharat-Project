The Nāṭyaśāstra is an encyclopeadic work composed by Sage Bharata 2 millenina ago, to deliver a descriptive work encompassing every detail about the knowledge of nāṭya​, which includes dance, drama, and music. A voluminous work of 6000 couplets is divided into 36 chapters that explain the birth of nāṭya​, the construction of play house, the karaṇa​s, aṅgahāra​s, prosody, instrumental music, types of play, costuming, success of a production, descent of drama on Earth and the like. This classical (mārgi) text of art is often reckoned as the 'nāṭya veda​.'
