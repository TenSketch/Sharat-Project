      content : "Pregnancy is god’s precious gift and also it’s the perfect time for her to enjoy motherhood. Yes!!! I enjoyed every cycle of it and my biggest support for this to happen was my trainer Mrs. Gayathri Suresh. All the topics were covered very well and she makes us more comfortable in learning and understanding them. We used to ask too many doubts and we got it cleared every time, not only during sessions but whenever we are bothered by anything we used to call her and get it sorted immediately. It’s so comfortable for us to attend that too in our convenient time and batch. I felt this course is necessary for every pregnant women and it’ll be more effective if you attend it as a couple. Mrs. Gayathri gives us lot of tips and it works well, you can feel it post birth too. Really we are gifted to have this course at the right time. I would like to recommend this course to my friends and family and feel so happy for that."
